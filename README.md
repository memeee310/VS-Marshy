### Installing the Required Programs

First you need to install Haxe and HaxeFlixel. I'm too lazy to write and keep updated with that setup (which is pretty simple). 
1. [Install Haxe 4.1.5](https://haxe.org/download/version/4.1.5/) (Download 4.1.5 instead of 4.2.0 because 4.2.0 is broken and is not working with gits properly...)
2. [Install HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/install-haxeflixel/) after downloading Haxe

Other installations you'd need is the additional libraries, a fully updated list will be in `Project.xml` in the project root. Currently, these are all of the things you need to install:
```
haxelib install lime 7.9.0
haxelib install openfl
haxelib install flixel
haxelib run lime setup
haxelib run lime setup flixel
haxelib install flixel-tools
haxelib run flixel-tools setup
haxelib install flixel-addons
haxelib install flixel-ui
haxelib install hscript
haxelib install newgrounds
haxelib git linc_luajit https://github.com/AndreiRudenko/linc_luajit.git
haxelib git faxe https://github.com/uhrobots/faxe
haxelib git polymod https://github.com/larsiusprime/polymod.git
haxelib git discord_rpc https://github.com/Aidan63/linc_discord-rpc
haxelib install actuate
haxelib git extension-webm https://github.com/KadeDev/extension-webm
lime rebuild extension-webm <ie. windows, macos, linux>

```
So for each of those type `haxelib install [library]` so shit like `haxelib install newgrounds`
You should have everything ready for compiling the game! Follow the guide below to continue!

### Compiling game

Once you have all those installed, it's pretty easy to compile the game. You just need to run 'lime test html5 -debug' in the root of the project to build and run the HTML5 version. (command prompt navigation guide can be found here: [https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480](https://ninjamuffin99.newgrounds.com/news/post/1090480))

To run it from your desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) it can be a bit more involved. For Linux, you only need to open a terminal in the project directory and run 'lime test linux -debug' and then run the executable file in export/release/linux/bin. For Windows, you need to install Visual Studio Community 2019. While installing VSC, don't click on any of the options to install workloads. Instead, go to the individual components tab and choose the following:

* MSVC v142 - VS 2019 C++ x64/x86 build tools
* MSVC v141 - VS 2017 C++ x64/x86 build tools
* Windows SDK (10.0.17763.0)
* C++ Profiling tools
* C++ CMake tools for windows
* C++ ATL for v142 build tools (x86 & x64)

This will install about 7GB of crap, but once that is done you can open up a command line in the project's directory and run `lime test windows -debug`. Once that command finishes (it takes forever even on a higher end PC), you can run FNF from the .exe file under export\release\windows\bin
As for Mac, 'lime test mac -debug' should work, if not the internet surely has a guide on how to compile Haxe stuff for Mac.
